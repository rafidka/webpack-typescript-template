This template can be used to build a web app using Webpack and TypeScript. Or, perhaps, it is more accurate to sayy using TypeScript and Webpack.

The main entry point of the application is [index.ts](src/index.ts). It contains two simple functions to add few images and a button to the main page. 

The template is npm-based. The following scripts are available:

- `npm rum build`: Build the application and create the output files under the `dist` folder.
- `npm run start`: Starts a development server running the application.
- `npm run watch`: Run the application in watch mode, so that the page is automatically reloaded if a change is made.
